# Remember that rules are formatted as
# State Surroundings -> Move NewState

# Picobot starts in state 0.

# Here, state 0 and state 1 orient picobot to 
# the NE-corner of the empty room.

0 x*** -> N 0   # if there's nothing to the N, go N
0 N*** -> X 1   # if N is blocked, switch to state 1

1 *x** -> E 1   # we begin to go E to our corner
1 NE** -> X 2   # if we hit NE-corner, switch to state 2

# Here, state 2 and 3 loop picobot up and down, moving W
# one spot every time it's done with a column until the
# entire room has been explored

2 ***x -> S 2   # if there's nothing to the S, go S
2 **xS -> W 3   # if at bottom, move W and go to state 3

3 x*** -> N 3   # if there's nothing to the N, go N
3 N*x* -> W 2   # if at top, move W and go to state 2
