This is a sample text file. This will help us determine the behavior of certain input and output functions.
This is the start of the second line of text.
If we add random stuff here at the start of a new file then we might be able to obtain behavior that is not as predictable as before.
To be able to determine random behavior effectively is an impossiblity. This is not used to determine anything but we can be certain that some behavior may be able to be predicted.
